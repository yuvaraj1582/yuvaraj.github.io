<p><b>The pomegranate, botanical name Punica granatum, is a fruit-bearing deciduous shrub or small tree in the family Lythraceae that grows between 5 and 8 m tall. Pomegranate is one of the oldest known fruit and so called “fruit of paradise”. The production and consumption of pomegranate has greatly increased in recent years, at least partly due to recognition of the health-promoting potential of various components of this fruit. The fruit has wide consumer preference for its attractive, juicy, sweet-acidic and refreshing arils and there is a growing demand for good quality fruits both for fresh use and processing into juice, syrup and wine.</b></p>
